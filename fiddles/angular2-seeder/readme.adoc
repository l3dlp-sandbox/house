= Angular2 Seeder

_Angular, Spangular_ Its ubiquitous.  Unfortunately, as I have found over the last few weeks ( _months_ )
working with the framework (see the link:../Angular2[Angular2 collection]), there is an obstacle to entry-- _tooling_.

Creating an Angular2 app doesn't begin with a story board (or idea).  It begins with _tooling_. It begins
with deciding how your code base will go from typescript to transpiled javascript. _Gulp and Grunt or webpack_?
Short of playing with the link:https://cli.angular.io/[Angular Cmd Line Interface (CLI)], which (as of the writing
of this _markdown_) is not quite ready for _production_, there are _seeder project templates_.

This collection is aimed at POC's experimenting with the link:https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular-seed-advanced[angular2 seed advanced]
template.  The `fiddle.sh` script can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.

### Issue

[Issue 145](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/145)


### Description

Create a straight Javascript POC (ES6 + JQuery + bootstrap) that virtualizes [enipuzzle](http://www.enipuzzles.com/).   The POC should present a grid of 64 colored cells.  The palette should consist of 8 colors: yellow, yellow-green, blue-green, blue, violet, red-orange, orange, yellow-orange.   There should be 7 yellow-green cells.  All other colors should be applied to exactly  8 cells.  On startup, the colors of the cells should be randomly distributed throughout the grid, with the last cell of the grid be left blank (transparent).  The surrounding background of the app should be white.  To complete the puzzle, the user must put the cells in order by color from left to right.   Horizontal rotation is virtualized by swiping individual rows to the left or right.   Cells can be re-ordered vertically using the one empty (transparent) square.

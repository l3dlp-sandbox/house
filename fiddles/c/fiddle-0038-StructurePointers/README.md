[Issue 142](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/142)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 11.4 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  
This program rewrites program 9.1 (See [fiddle #27](../fiddle-0027-DateStruct)) using structure pointer notation.

### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0027"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE

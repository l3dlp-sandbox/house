### Issue

[Issue 148](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/148)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 11.9 from Stephen Kochan's book [Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition](#).  
This program demonstrates how to pass pointers to a function as arguments.


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0041"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH
    FIDDLE-START.SH
    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    pointersinfunctions started
    
    *i1 = -5, i2 = 66
    *i1 = 66, i2 = -5
    *i1 = -5, i2 = 66
    
    pointersinfunctions ended

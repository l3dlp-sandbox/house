### Issue

[Issue 151](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/151)


### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 11.13 from Stephen Kochan's book [Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition](#).  
This program illustrates how to use a pointer to navigate a character string.


### Use Case

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0044"
    
This should produce the following output:

     {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
     FIDDLE.SH
     FIDDLE-START.SH
     ├────STARTSERVER
     ├────GCCSTART
     ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
     
     charstringpointer started
     
     A string to be copied.
     So is this.
     
     charstringpointer ended

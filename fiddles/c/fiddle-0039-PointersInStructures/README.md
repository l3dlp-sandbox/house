### Description

Create a fiddle based on Program 11.5 from Stephen Kochan's book Programming in C (Developer's Library) 4th Edition.  
This program demonstrates how to create a structure containing pointer attributes.

Navigate to the scripts directory and execute the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh "start" "c" "0039"
    
This should produce the following output:

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    FIDDLE.SH

    ├────STARTSERVER
    ├────GCCSTART
    ├────INVOKING EXECUTABLE
    
    pointersinstructures started
    
    i1 = 100, *pointers.p1 = 100
    i2 = -97, *pointers.p2 = -97
    
    pointersinstructures ended
